# About-this-site
This will be the future home of the TheWeBWorKProjects collection of "model courses". 
The courses will consist of questions assembled from the OpenProblemLibrary at https://github.com/openwebwork.

Each repository on this site is a model course which can be easily uploaded for plug-and-play.
